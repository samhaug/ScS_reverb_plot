# ScS_reverb_plot

This directory contains all the scripts needed to plot figures for this
paper. They should all reference data/simulations that live outside of 
this directory and don't get pushed to github.

verify_zeroth_order plots data and synthetics for runs of different PREM
perturbations. This is a tool to help determine which perturbed PREM model
explains ScS reverberation traveltimes best.

verify_depth_phase is a tool for finding what the optimum depth of a given
event should be to align depth phases correctly.
